Data structures provide a way to structure and organize data elements and enable various data manipulation and retrieval operations.

Data structures are essential for optimizing the use of computer memory and improving the efficiency of data processing.\n",

It is a mathematical model or a set of rules that govern the behavior of a data structure, independent of any specific programming language or hardware."

        "1. **Linear Data Structure:**\n",
        "   - In a linear data structure, elements are arranged in a linear or sequential order.\n",
        "   - Elements follow a specific order, and each element has a unique predecessor and successor, except for the first and last elements.\n",
        "   - Examples include arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Static Data Structure:**\n",
        "   - A static data structure has a fixed size, and its size does not change during the program's execution.\n",
        "   - Memory is allocated at compile-time, and it remains constant throughout the program.\n",
        "   - Arrays are an example of a static data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Non-Static (Dynamic) Data Structure:**\n",
        "   - A non-static or dynamic data structure can grow or shrink in size during the program's execution.\n",
        "   - Memory is allocated or deallocated at run-time, allowing for flexibility in managing data.\n",
        "   - Examples include linked lists, trees, and dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Non-Linear Data Structure:**\n",
        "   - In a non-linear data structure, elements are not arranged in a sequential manner.\n",
        "   - Elements may have more than one predecessor and successor, forming a hierarchical or interconnected structure.\n",
        "   - Examples include trees and graphs.\n",
        "   - Trees have a hierarchical structure with a root node and branches, while graphs allow arbitrary connections between nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**\n",
        "- An array is a linear and static data structure.\n",
        "- A linked list is a linear and dynamic (non-static) data structure.\n",
        "- A tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure.\n",
        "- A graph is a non-linear and interconnected data structure.\n",
