        "   - Example: Finding an element in an unsorted list through linear search.\n",

        "   - Example: Nested loops iterating through all combinations in a 2D array.\n",

        "- **Data Types:** Pointers in C/C++ are typically associated with specific data types like integers, characters, etc. For instance, an `int*` pointer is meant to point to integer variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Understanding Void Pointer:\n",
        "- **Versatility:** Unlike specific pointers (like `int*` or `char*`), a `void*` pointer is a generic or \"universal\" pointer that doesn’t have a specific data type.\n",
        "- **No Data Type Association:** It doesn't know the size or structure of the data it's pointing to.\n",
        "- **Usage:** Useful in situations where you want to create a pointer that can point to different types of data at different times.\n",
        "  \n",

        "```c\n",
        "void* ptr; // Declaring a void pointer\n",
        "\n",
        "int number = 10;\n",
        "char letter = 'A';\n",

        "ptr = &letter;\n",
        "```\n",

        "##### Caution:\n",

        "##### Use Cases:\n",
