Data structures provide a way to structure and organize data elements and enable various data manipulation and retrieval operations. They serve as the building blocks for designing and implementing algorithms and solving specific computational problems. Data structures are essential for optimizing the use of computer memory and improving the efficiency of data processing.\n",
